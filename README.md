## Ideas
I want to include the following features:
- list-group-flush list that will just list the recipes and allow for easy view of recipes
- once clicked, opens the recipe with a picture of what the dish should look like and then the details about the recipe(name, time to cook, time to prep(if necessary), how many it feeds, ingredients, steps)
- no login/register/logout

### Maybe Add
- a create/add button to add new recipes
